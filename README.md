TV + Remote Demo
Control your desktop or large screen browser with your iPhone.

Why was this created?
TV watching has traditionally been seen as a passive experience. Through social technology and second screen thinking, new opportunities for rich, interactive stories are created.

How was this built?
Full Javascript stack: NodeJS, ExpressJS, Socket.io, YouTube API, jQuery.

Keeping the entire stack in HTML5 and Javascript makes it possible to iterate quickly and fluidly and really focus on the core user experience.

What's next?
Changes in distributed content, hardware manufacturing, and consumer behavior will also need to catch-up in order to provide a compelling second screen experience. So in short, we don't know what's to come next but that's OK. What's more important is we enjoy the rollercoaster ride.
